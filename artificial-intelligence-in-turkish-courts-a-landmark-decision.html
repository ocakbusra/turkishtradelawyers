                    <h1>Artificial Intelligence in Turkish Courts:<br> A Landmark Decision</h1>
                </header>

                <section class="article-content">
                    <p>Artificial intelligence is a technology that enables computers and machines to simulate human
                        abilities such as learning, comprehension, problem-solving, decision-making, creativity, and
                        autonomy.</p>

                    <p>Today, the use of artificial intelligence has become widespread across society, ranging from
                        everyday tasks to the resolution of the most complex problems, and even, at the next agent
                        stage, to the direct execution of actions.</p>

                    <p>In technical evaluation and problem-solving, setting aside issues such as hallucination and
                        various risks, artificial intelligence has the potential to produce results that are often even
                        more successful than those of an expert in the relevant field. This is because it is nearly
                        impossible for a single expert to simultaneously possess all the information available within
                        the learning model of artificial intelligence and produce a solution accordingly. For artificial
                        intelligence to arrive at a correct solution, however, the path to be followed must be properly
                        determined, and the source information required to reach the desired outcome must be accurately
                        provided. This aspect is particularly significant in terms of prompt engineering.</p>

                    <p>Given that artificial intelligence has penetrated even daily tasks to such an extent and has
                        taken on a tangible presence within society, it is beyond doubt that the law must also determine
                        in which areas this tool should be utilized. Indeed, pursuant to the principle whose origins
                        date back to the Magna Carta (<em>"To no one will we sell, to no one will we deny or delay,
                            right or justice"</em>) and which is expressed as <strong>"Justice delayed is justice
                            denied,"</strong> justice must not only be established correctly but also without delay.
                        This principle is protected under Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights and finds
                        its counterpart in Turkish law under Article 141, paragraph 4 of the Constitution of the
                        Republic of Türkiye.</p>

                    <p>A decision rendered by the İstanbul 14th Commercial Court of First Instance has marked a
                        milestone in the Turkish judiciary (see İstanbul 14th Commercial Court of First Instance,
                        decision dated 15.05.2025, numbered 2023/856 E., 2025/415 K.). By explicitly stating that
                        artificial intelligence was used as a tool during the judicial process, the Court delivered its
                        judgment by also addressing the principles governing the context in which artificial
                        intelligence was employed in adjudication. In this decision, the Court utilized artificial
                        intelligence for technical evaluations falling outside the non-delegable elements of the
                        judicial function—namely legal interpretation, the formation of conscientious conviction, and
                        decision-making—within the framework of the Principle Decision of the Ethics Board for Public
                        Officials of the Republic of Türkiye dated 10.09.2024 and numbered 2024/108, titled "Ethical
                        Principles to Be Observed by Public Officials in the Use of Artificial Intelligence Systems."
                    </p>

                    <h2>Background of the Case: International Recognition and Enforcement Proceedings</h2>

                    <p>The case concerns a request for the recognition and enforcement in Türkiye of a judgment rendered
                        by a Dutch court. The claimant is a Netherlands-based healthcare consultancy company which
                        sought the enforcement in Türkiye of a decision rendered by the Amsterdam Court against a
                        Turkish hospital company, concerning receivables that could not be collected in return for
                        consultancy services provided for the establishment of an eye clinic in the Netherlands. The
                        decision included a principal receivable of EUR 150,936 as well as a contractual penalty.</p>

                    <p>During the proceedings, the Court used artificial intelligence as a tool for the verification and
                        translation of the Dutch court decisions on which the claimant relied for recognition and
                        enforcement.</p>

                    <h2>Unprecedented Transparency: The Court's Disclosure of Its Use of Artificial Intelligence</h2>

                    <p>What truly renders this decision extraordinary is the unprecedented level of transparency
                        demonstrated by the Court regarding its use of artificial intelligence. In its reasoned
                        decision, the Court explicitly stated the following:</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        "As an explanation regarding the use of technological tools during the judicial process, it is
                        noted that, in the course of preparing this decision, artificial intelligence technology was
                        utilized as a technical tool for the verification of the decisions of the Dutch judiciary relied
                        upon by the claimant party…"
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>The Court particularly emphasized that this use was carried out in accordance with the principles
                        of procedural law and in line with the Principle Decision of the Ethics Board for Public
                        Officials of the Republic of Türkiye dated 10.09.2024 and numbered 2024/108, titled "Ethical
                        Principles to Be Observed by Public Officials in the Use of Artificial Intelligence Systems."
                    </p>

                    <h2>Details of the Use of Artificial Intelligence</h2>

                    <h4>Purpose and Scope of Use</h4>

                    <p>As stated in the Court's decision, artificial intelligence technology was used as a technical
                        tool in the following areas:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Verification of Dutch Judicial Decisions:</strong> Checking the accuracy of the
                            Dutch court decisions relied upon by the claimant party</li>
                        <li><strong>Translation of Dutch Legal Texts into Turkish:</strong> Providing translation
                            support to ensure comprehension of legal documents in a foreign language</li>
                        <li><strong>Access to Foreign Legal Sources:</strong> Accessing information regarding Dutch law
                            and judicial practice</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Principles Relied Upon by the Court Within the Scope of Compliance with Ethical Standards</h2>

                    <p>In evaluating the use of artificial intelligence during the judicial process, the Court
                        explicitly referred to the following principles within the framework of the Principle Decision
                        of the Ethics Board for Public Officials of the Republic of Türkiye dated 10.09.2024 and
                        numbered 2024/108 ("Ethical Principles to Be Observed by Public Officials in the Use of
                        Artificial Intelligence Systems"):</p>

                    <h4>Legality and Adherence to Principles of Procedural Law</h4>
                    <p>It was accepted that the use of artificial intelligence was compatible with procedural law
                        principles and that its use as a technical tool for the purpose of verifying foreign court
                        decisions did not constitute unlawfulness.</p>

                    <h4>Principle of Technical Tool Nature</h4>
                    <p>It was stated that utilizing artificial intelligence for access to foreign legal sources and for
                        translation purposes constitutes a legitimate technical support tool, comparable to the use of a
                        calculator, within the scope of the judge's duty to accurately ascertain facts and law.</p>

                    <h4>Principle of Competence</h4>
                    <p>It was expressed that artificial intelligence was used to support cognitive development and
                        enhance public interest awareness; that the system was used with awareness of its potential to
                        produce incomplete or erroneous outputs; that the conditions of use were learned in advance; and
                        that conscious use was ensured.</p>

                    <h4>Right to a Trial Within a Reasonable Time</h4>
                    <p>It was assessed that utilizing technological tools in researching foreign judicial decisions
                        through the official websites of foreign courts serves the right to a trial within a reasonable
                        time and is therefore lawful.</p>

                    <h4>Principle of Choosing the Most Appropriate Tool (Ethics Board Decision, Article 7)</h4>
                    <p>It was stated that artificial intelligence was preferred because it constituted the most
                        appropriate tool to resolve the issue in the specific case.</p>

                    <h4>Principle of Transparency</h4>
                    <p>It was emphasized that the use of artificial intelligence was explicitly disclosed; that all
                        sources, articles, and links used were recorded; and that, in this manner, an auditable and
                        reviewable structure suitable for appellate review was established.</p>

                    <h4>Principle of Accountability</h4>
                    <p>It was stated that all processes relating to the use of artificial intelligence were recorded,
                        thereby rendering them open to judicial review, and that legal and ethical responsibility for
                        the content used was assumed.</p>

                    <h4>Principle of Integrity – Disclosure</h4>
                    <p>In compliance with the obligation set forth in the Ethics Board Decision to clearly disclose the
                        use of artificial intelligence, it was accepted that such use was explicitly stated in the
                        reasoning of the decision.</p>

                    <h4>Principle of Integrity – Originality</h4>
                    <p>It was emphasized that content generated by artificial intelligence was not presented as if it
                        had been personally created by the judge, and that artificial intelligence was used solely as a
                        research and technical support tool.</p>

                    <h4>Accuracy and Verification Obligation</h4>
                    <p>It was explicitly stated that the accuracy of artificial intelligence outputs was independently
                        verified; however, due to the inability to have the Turkish translations of Dutch legal texts
                        certified by a sworn translator, there remained a risk of potential misunderstandings arising
                        from translation errors. Nevertheless, it was noted that if such errors were to concretely
                        affect the reasoning, they could be subject to legal remedies.</p>

                    <h4>Principle of Confidentiality and Data Protection</h4>
                    <p>It was stated that no personal data were shared during the use of artificial intelligence and
                        that maximum care was exercised regarding the protection of personal data.</p>

                    <h4>Duty of Control and Supervision</h4>
                    <p>It was accepted that all data, content, and outputs generated by artificial intelligence were
                        reviewed by the judge in terms of accuracy and reliability.</p>

                    <h4>Principle of Non-Delegation of Authority</h4>
                    <p>It was emphasized that artificial intelligence was not used in areas falling within the exclusive
                        authority of the judge—such as legal interpretation, evaluation of evidence, formation of
                        conscientious conviction, and determination of final legal conclusions—and that the final
                        decision rested entirely within the judge's discretion.</p>

                    <h4>Principle of Avoiding Decision-Making by Artificial Intelligence in Important Public Matters
                    </h4>
                    <p>As stipulated in the Ethics Board Decision, it was stated that artificial intelligence was never
                        used as a decision-maker, but solely served a research and technical support function.</p>

                    <h4>Principle of Impartiality and Objectivity</h4>
                    <p>It was stated that artificial intelligence data were not used in a manner that would create bias,
                        and that an objective analysis was conducted with due regard to public interest.</p>

                    <h4>Principle of Respect for Intellectual and Industrial Property Rights</h4>
                    <p>It was accepted that methods carrying a risk of plagiarism were avoided in the use of artificial
                        intelligence and that accuracy checks were conducted to prevent misinformation.</p>

                    <h4>Human-Centered Approach</h4>
                    <p>It was explicitly stated that the process was conducted with an understanding that respects human
                        dignity and welfare and human rights, and that artificial intelligence never replaced human
                        will.</p>

                    <h2>Conclusion: A New Era for the Turkish Judiciary</h2>

                    <p>This decision of the İstanbul 14th Commercial Court of First Instance dated 15 May 2025
                        constitutes a turning point for the Turkish judiciary. The Court explicitly declared its use of
                        artificial intelligence, while fully preserving human judgment, conscientious conviction, and
                        decision-making processes—which form the essence of judicial authority—within the exclusive
                        domain of the judge.</p>

                    <p>This decision represents a modern reflection of the principle that <strong>"justice delayed is
                            justice denied."</strong> Artificial intelligence has been positioned not as a substitute
                        for the judiciary, but as a tool that serves the establishment of justice in a faster, more
                        effective, and higher-quality manner.</p>

                    <p>It is evident that this decision, rendered on the basis of transparency, adherence to ethical
                        principles, and a human-centered approach, will be discussed and referenced for many years by
                        both the Turkish judiciary and the international legal community.</p>
