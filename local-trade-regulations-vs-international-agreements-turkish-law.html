                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>For foreign entities operating in Türkiye, the interplay between domestic administrative
                        regulations and international trade commitments is a critical area of legal risk. Türkiye
                        operates under a "monist" legal system where international agreements are incorporated directly
                        into domestic law upon ratification. However, in practice, businesses often face a complex layer
                        of secondary legislation—Communiqués, Board Decisions, and Customs Circulars—that may appear to
                        conflict with the free trade provisions established in the World Trade Organization (WTO)
                        agreements or Türkiye's bilateral Free Trade Agreements (FTAs).</p>
                    <p>This article clarifies the legal hierarchy under Turkish law, defining how conflicts between
                        local trade regulations and international agreements are resolved, and provides actionable
                        guidance for ensuring compliance while leveraging international treaty protections.</p>
                </section>

                <section id="legal-framework" class="article-content">
                    <h2>Legal Framework Under Turkish Law</h2>
                    <p>The relationship between international law and domestic law in Türkiye is governed by the
                        Constitution and primary statutory codes. The hierarchy is rigid, and understanding it is the
                        first step in dispute resolution.</p>

                    <h4>1. The Constitutional Basis (Supremacy of Treaties)</h4>
                    <p>The cornerstone of this legal analysis is <strong>Article 90 of the Constitution of the Republic
                            of Türkiye</strong>.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Article 90/5</strong> states that international agreements duly put into effect have
                            the force of law.</li>
                        <li>Crucially, it stipulates that no appeal to the Constitutional Court can be made with regard
                            to these agreements on the grounds that they are unconstitutional.</li>
                        <li><strong>The Conflict Rule:</strong> In cases of conflict between international agreements
                            regarding <strong>fundamental rights and freedoms</strong> and domestic laws, the provisions
                            of the international agreement prevail. For <strong>commercial and trade
                                agreements</strong>, while the text does not explicitly grant "supremacy" over
                            <em>statutes</em> (laws enacted by Parliament) in the same absolute terms as human rights
                            treaties, established legal practice and statutory interpretation principles generally
                            accord them priority over <em>secondary legislation</em> (regulations, communiqués).
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>2. Customs Law No. 4458</h4>
                    <p>The <strong>Customs Law (Law No. 4458)</strong> is the primary statute governing cross-border
                        trade.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>It is largely harmonized with the European Union Customs Code due to the Customs Union
                            agreement.</li>
                        <li><strong>Article 1</strong> of Law No. 4458 explicitly sets the scope of customs obligations,
                            which must be interpreted in line with Türkiye's international obligations.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>3. Turkish Commercial Code (Law No. 6102)</h4>
                    <p>While the TCC governs private commercial relations, <strong>Article 1</strong> and subsequent
                        general principles require merchants to act in accordance with "good faith" and "commercial
                        honesty," which includes adherence to the regulatory framework derived from international
                        treaties ratified by Türkiye.</p>
                </section>

                <section id="regulations-vs-agreements" class="article-content">
                    <h2>Local Trade Regulations vs International Trade Agreements</h2>
                    <p>The central legal issue arises when a Ministry (e.g., Ministry of Trade) issues a
                        <strong>Communiqué</strong> (tebliğ) or <strong>Regulation</strong> (yönetmelik) that imposes
                        stricter technical barriers, additional tax burdens, or labeling requirements than those agreed
                        upon in an FTA or the Customs Union Decision (1/95).
                    </p>

                    <h4>The Hierarchy of Norms (Normlar Hiyerarşisi)</h4>
                    <p>Under Turkish administrative law, the hierarchy is as follows:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Constitution</strong></li>
                        <li><strong>International Agreements</strong> (duly ratified) & <strong>Codes/Statutes</strong>
                            (Kanun)</li>
                        <li><strong>Presidential Decrees</strong> (Cumhurbaşkanlığı Kararnamesi)</li>
                        <li><strong>Regulations</strong> (Yönetmelik)</li>
                        <li><strong>Communiqués</strong> (Tebliğ) & Circulars (Genelge)</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h4>Resolution of Conflict</h4>
                    <p>If a local <strong>Communiqué</strong> restricts trade in a manner inconsistent with a ratified
                        <strong>International Treaty</strong>:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Legal Supremacy:</strong> The International Treaty prevails over the Communiqué. A
                            lower-level norm (Communiqué) cannot contradict a higher-level norm (Treaty/Law).</li>
                        <li><strong>Implementation:</strong> In practice, customs officers strictly follow the
                            electronic customs system (Bilge System) and active Communiqués. They rarely have the
                            discretion to "disregard" a Communiqué based on a treaty argument at the border.</li>
                        <li><strong>Remedy:</strong> The remedy lies in administrative litigation (filing a lawsuit for
                            the annulment of the administrative act) or seeking a correction assessment after payment
                            under protest (<em>ihtirazi kayıt</em>).</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>

                <section id="obligations-and-risks" class="article-content">
                    <h2>Key Legal Obligations and Risks</h2>
                    <p>Foreign businesses must navigate these specific risks where local practice often diverges from
                        international treaty text:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Surveillance Measures (Gözetim Uygulaması):</strong> The Ministry of Trade
                            frequently imposes surveillance on imports based on unit prices (referencing <em>Communiqués
                                on Surveillance in Imports</em>). While this creates a <em>de facto</em> minimum import
                            price, which arguably conflicts with WTO Valuation Agreement rules, it is a prevalent local
                            practice.</li>
                        <li><strong>Additional Customs Duties (Ilave Gümrük Vergisi - IGV):</strong> Türkiye imposes
                            additional duties on non-EU/FTA origin goods. Compliance requires precise
                            <strong>Certificates of Origin</strong>. A failure to prove preferential origin results in
                            the application of the full statutory tax rate, regardless of the commercial contract terms.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT):</strong> Products must meet Turkish Standards
                            (TSE) or CE marking requirements. <strong>Law No. 7223 on Product Safety and Technical
                                Regulations</strong> places strict liability on importers to ensure products meet these
                            technical regulations, which are legally treated as equivalent to domestic law.</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>

                <section id="court-decisions" class="article-content">
                    <h2>Relevant Turkish Court Decisions</h2>
                    <p>Disputes regarding the supremacy of international agreements over domestic administrative acts
                        are adjudicated by the Administrative Courts and the Council of State (<em>Danıştay</em>).</p>

                    <h4>Council of State (Danıştay) Jurisprudence on Hierarchy:</h4>
                    <p>There is established case law of the Council of State confirming that administrative acts (such
                        as Regulations or Communiqués) cannot introduce restrictions that contravene the clear
                        provisions of a ratified international agreement. The Council of State consistently applies the
                        principle that the administration is bound by the hierarchy of norms.</p>
                    <p><em>Note: While specific recent E./K. numbers for pending commercial cases are often confidential
                            or not publicly indexed in real-time, the 10th Chamber of the Council of State has
                            historically ruled that administrative discretion cannot override specific treaty
                            obligations.</em></p>

                    <h4>Court of Cassation (Yargıtay) on Private Commercial Disputes:</h4>
                    <p>In disputes between private parties (e.g., a distributor claiming damages for non-compliance with
                        local regulations), the Court of Cassation (e.g., 11th Civil Chamber) generally holds that
                        merchants are expected to know and comply with <em>mandatory</em> domestic provisions (Emredici
                        Hükümler) of Turkish law, even if an international contract attempts to waive them.</p>

                    <blockquote><strong>Practitioner's Note:</strong> Do not assume a "treaty defense" will
                        automatically work as a shield in lower courts without expert procedural handling. Turkish
                        courts require specific pleading of Article 90 and a clear demonstration of the conflict.

                    <h2>Practical Compliance Recommendations</h2>
                    <p>To mitigate risks arising from the conflict between local regulations and international
                        agreements:</p>

                    <h4>1. Payment Under Protest (İhtirazi Kayıt):</h4>
                    <p>If a customs authority demands duties or imposes penalties based on a secondary regulation you
                        believe violates an FTA or the Customs Union rules, you should formally declare the goods and
                        pay the duties "under protest" (<em>ihtirazi kayıtla</em>). This preserves your right to file a
                        lawsuit in Tax Court within <strong>30 days</strong>. Without this reservation, you lose the
                        right to litigation.</p>

                    <h4>2. Certificate of Origin Management:</h4>
                    <p>Strictly adhere to the specific "Rules of Origin" protocol of the relevant FTA. A generic "Made
                        in [Country]" statement on an invoice is insufficient for Turkish Customs. You must strictly use
                        EUR.1, A.TR, or invoice declarations as authorized by the specific treaty.</p>

                    <h4>3. Contractual Allocations of Risk:</h4>
                    <p>In your Distribution or Sale & Purchase Agreements, explicitly allocate the risk of "Changes in
                        Law" and "Trade Defense Measures" (e.g., anti-dumping duties, safeguard measures). Under the
                        <strong>Turkish Code of Obligations (Law No. 6098)</strong>, unexpected regulatory changes can
                        sometimes trigger "hardship" (Art. 138), but well-drafted contracts should preempt this
                        uncertainty.
                    </p>

                    <h4>4. Monitor "Official Gazette" (Resmi Gazete):</h4>
                    <p>Trade regulations in Türkiye change rapidly. Surveillance communiqués and import bans are
                        published in the Official Gazette and enter into force immediately or within days. Relying on
                        annual summaries is insufficient.</p>

                    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                    <p>While Article 90 of the Turkish Constitution theoretically guarantees the supremacy of
                        international trade agreements, the operational reality involves a dense web of domestic
                        regulations that often take precedence at the border. For foreign investors and traders, the key
                        to success is not merely relying on the "superiority" of international law, but rather ensuring
                        meticulous compliance with local administrative requirements while preserving legal rights to
                        challenge discrepancies through the correct procedural channels.</p>

                <section id="faqs" class="article-content">
                    <h2>FAQs</h2>
                    <h4>1. Does a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) automatically override a Turkish Customs Communiqué?</h4>
                    <p>Legally, yes, under the hierarchy of norms. However, operationally, customs officers apply the
                        Communiqué active in their system. You may need to pay the disputed amount under protest and
                        claim a refund through litigation to enforce the FTA.</p>

                    <h4>2. Can I sue the Turkish government if a new regulation blocks my imports contrary to WTO rules?
                    </h4>
                    <p>You can file an annulment action in the Council of State (<em>Danıştay</em>) or a Tax Court case
                        against the specific transaction. However, direct "damages" for legislative acts are difficult
                        to claim. The primary remedy is usually the annulment of the administrative act.</p>

                    <h4>3. What is "Payment Under Protest" (İhtirazi Kayıt) in Türkiye?</h4>
                    <p>It is a critical procedural declaration made during the customs declaration phase. It signifies
                        that you pay the demanded tax/duty to release your goods but reserve the right to challenge its
                        legality in court. If you fail to make this reservation, the payment is deemed voluntary and
                        final.</p>
