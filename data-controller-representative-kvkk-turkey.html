                        The Turkish Personal Data Protection Law No. 6698 ("KVKK"), which came into full force in 2016,
                        has significantly transformed the regulatory landscape for data privacy in Türkiye. Although the
                        KVKK does not expressly regulate extraterritorial application in the same manner as the GDPR,
                        the Turkish Personal Data Protection Board has consistently interpreted the Law to apply where
                        personal data processing activities are directed at data subjects located in Türkiye or target
                        the Turkish market.
                    </p>
                    <p>As experienced Turkish lawyers, we frequently observe that foreign companies often overlook their
                        local compliance requirements until they face substantial administrative sanctions. Central to
                        these requirements for non-resident entities is the mandatory appointment of a <strong>Data
                            Controller Representative</strong>.</p>
                </section>

                <section id="scope" class="article-content">
                    <h2>1. The Extraterritorial Scope of the KVKK</h2>
                    <p>The KVKK applies to data processing activities that are directed at individuals located in
                        Türkiye or involve offering goods or services to the Turkish market, as interpreted through the
                        established practice of the Turkish Personal Data Protection Board.
                        Whether you are a global e-commerce platform, a SaaS provider, or a multinational
                        corporation with no physical presence in the country, if you process the personal data of
                        Turkish residents, you are bound by the KVKK.</p>
                </section>

                <section id="mandate" class="article-content">
                    <h2>2. The Mandate: Data Controller Representative</h2>
                    <p>In accordance with Article 16 of the KVKK and the <em>Regulation on the Data Controllers
                            Registry</em>, data controllers not established in Türkiye must appoint a "Data Controller
                        Representative" (Veri Sorumlusu Temsilcisi). This obligation was further detailed by the Turkish
                        Personal Data Protection Board's ("Board") Decision No. 2019/387.</p>
                    <p>The representative acts as the primary point of communication between the foreign data controller
                        and the Turkish Personal Data Protection Authority ("Authority").</p>
                </section>

                <section id="who-must-appoint" class="article-content">
                    <h2>3. Who Must Appoint a Representative?</h2>
                    <p>All natural or legal persons who:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Are resident or established outside of Türkiye, AND</li>
                        <li>Process personal data of data subjects in Türkiye.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Unlike local Turkish companies, foreign companies do not benefit from the "employee count" or
                        "annual financial balance" exemptions (e.g., the 50 employees / 25 million TL threshold) that
                        exempt some small local businesses from VERBİS registration.</p>

                        <strong>Crucial Compliance Note:</strong> For foreign data controllers, registration with VERBİS
                        and the appointment of a representative is a <strong>mandatory requirement regardless of their
                            size, turnover, or employee count</strong>.
                    </div>
                </section>

                <section id="qualifications" class="article-content">
                    <h2>4. Qualifications and Duties of the Representative</h2>
                    <p>The representative must be either:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A Turkish citizen residing in Türkiye, or</li>
                        <li>A legal entity established in Türkiye.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The Board Decision No. 2019/387 clarifies that the representative's duties include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Communication:</strong> Facilitating correspondence between the Authority and the
                            data controller.</li>
                        <li><strong>Data Subject Requests:</strong> Receiving and facilitating responses to applications
                            made by data subjects in Türkiye.</li>
                        <li><strong>VERBİS Management:</strong> Executing and updating the registration on the Data
                            Controllers Registry Information System (VERBİS).</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>It is important to note that the appointment of a representative does not shift the legal
                        liability from the foreign data controller. The foreign entity remains the "Data Controller" and
                        is ultimately responsible for compliance.</p>

                    <h2>6. 2026 Administrative Sanctions and Enforcement Risks</h2>
                    <p>Non-compliance with the KVKK, particularly the failure to register with VERBİS or appoint a
                        representative, carries severe financial and reputational risks. Under Article 18 of the Law,
                        the Board is authorized to impose administrative fines, which are adjusted annually according to
                        the revaluation rate.</p>
                    <p>As of 2026, administrative fines imposed under Article 18 of the KVKK are updated annually in
                        accordance with the revaluation rate announced pursuant to the Turkish Tax Procedure Law.
                        Accordingly, violations such as failure to register with VERBİS or failure to appoint a Data
                        Controller Representative may result in significant administrative fines, depending on the
                        nature and severity of the breach.</p>
                    <p>Furthermore, the Board has the authority to order the cessation of data processing activities or
                        the deletion of unlawfully processed data, which can lead to significant operational disruptions
                        for global businesses.</p>
                    <p>In addition to monetary sanctions, the Board may impose corrective measures including suspension
                        of data processing activities, restriction of cross-border data transfers, and mandatory
                        deletion, destruction, or anonymization of unlawfully processed personal data. These measures
                        may cause substantial operational disruption for foreign companies operating without proper KVKK
                        compliance.</p>

                    <h2>7. Conclusion</h2>
                    <p>For foreign companies, the Turkish market offers vast opportunities, but these come with a
                        rigorous data protection compliance burden. Appointing a Data Controller Representative is the
                        first and most vital step toward ensuring <a href="kvkk-compliance-checklist.html"
                            style="color: #2D4CC8; text-decoration: none;">KVKK compliance</a>.</p>
                    <p>As the Authority increases its oversight and audit activities, non-resident companies must act
                        proactively. Legal counsel specializing in Turkish data protection law is essential to navigate
                        the nuances of VERBİS registration and to ensure that the relationship with the local
                        representative is structured to mitigate risk effectively.</p>

                                Controller Representative in Turkey?</h4>
                            <p style="color: #4B5563;">Any data controller residing or established outside of Turkey who
                                processes personal data of individuals residing in Turkey must appoint a representative.

                                small foreign companies?</h4>
                            <p style="color: #4B5563;">No. Unlike local companies, foreign data controllers must
                                register with VERBİS and appoint a representative regardless of their employee count or
                                annual turnover.</p>

                            <p style="color: #4B5563;">Duties include facilitating communication with the Authority,

                                registration?</h4>
                            <p style="color: #4B5563;">VERBİS is a public registry system where data controllers declare
                                their data processing activities, including data categories, purposes, and security
                                measures.</p>

                                for non-compliance?</h4>
                            <p style="color: #4B5563;">Administrative fines for failure to register with VERBİS are
                                severe, ranging significantly high based on annual revaluation rates, potentially
                                exceeding 9 million TRY.</p>
