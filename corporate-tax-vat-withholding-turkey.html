                    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
                    <p>Thanks to its strategic location bridging European, Asian, and Middle Eastern markets, Turkey
                        remains a significant trade and production hub for foreign investors. However, one of the most
                        critical issues for foreign businesses entering the Turkish market is compliance with the
                        frequently changing and technically detailed Turkish tax legislation.</p>
                    <p>With the enforcement of inflation accounting practices effective as of 2024 and continuing in
                        subsequent years, alongside mechanisms for corporate tax deductions and regulations regarding
                        the minimum corporate tax, foreign companies are required to plan their financial structures in
                        Turkey with increased diligence.</p>
                    <p>As <strong>Turkish Trade Lawyers (TTL)</strong>, in this guide, we address the <a

                        perspective of Turkish tax law for

                    <h2>2. Corporate Income Tax in Turkey</h2>
                    <p>In Turkey, corporate tax is regulated under the Corporate Tax Law No. 5520. For foreign
                        companies, the fundamental distinction is made based on the type of tax liability.</p>

                    <h3>Full Liability and Limited Liability</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Full Tax Liability (Tam Mükellefiyet):</strong><br>Entities with their legal seat or
                            place of business located in Turkey are taxed in Turkey on their <strong>entire global
                                income</strong>.</li>
                        <li><strong>Limited Tax Liability (Dar Mükellefiyet):</strong><br>Entities with both their legal
                            seat and place of business located outside of Turkey are subject to corporate tax in Turkey
                            <strong>only on their income derived from Turkey</strong>. These earnings are generally
                            obtained through a workplace, branch, or permanent representative in Turkey.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Corporate Tax Rates (Current Framework)</h3>
                    <p>Within the scope of the current legislation:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>General Corporate Tax Rate:</strong> 25%</li>
                        <li><strong>Banks, Financial Institutions, and Certain Financial Companies:</strong> 30%</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>In addition to this, certain deduction mechanisms are foreseen provided that specific conditions
                        are met:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Export Income Deduction:</strong><br>A 5-point reduction may be applied to the
                            corporate tax rate for earnings derived exclusively from exports, provided that relevant
                            conditions are met and the earnings can be segregated in accounting records.</li>
                        <li><strong>Manufacturing Activity Deduction:</strong><br>Limited rate reductions may be
                            applicable to earnings derived from production activities by manufacturers holding an
                            Industrial Registry Certificate.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <div class="callout-box"
                        style="background-color: #FEF2F2; border-left: 4px solid #DC2626; padding: 1rem 1.5rem; margin: 1.5rem 0; color: #991B1B;">
                        <strong>⚠️ Note:</strong> The application of these deductions is not automatic; the type of
                        activity, accounting segregation, and relevant legislative conditions must be evaluated
                        individually.
                    </div>

                    <h3>Domestic Minimum Corporate Tax</h3>
                    <p>With recent regulations, a "Domestic Minimum Corporate Tax" application has been introduced for
                        taxpayers whose corporate tax burden falls below a certain level due to tax exemptions and
                        deductions.</p>
                    <p>Under this system, excluding certain exceptions, the tax calculated on corporate earnings before
                        deductions and exemptions are applied is restricted from falling below a specific base amount.
                        The scope of the application and the technical calculation method should be evaluated in
                        accordance with the relevant secondary legislation and implementation guides.</p>

                    <div class="callout-box"
                        style="background-color: #EFF6FF; border-left: 4px solid #2D4CC8; padding: 1rem 1.5rem; margin: 1.5rem 0; color: #1E3A8A;">
                        <strong>Note:</strong> Furthermore, OECD Global Minimum Tax (Pillar 2 – 15%) regulations for
                        multinational groups with a consolidated annual revenue exceeding €750 million must also be
                        taken into consideration.

                    <h2>3. Value Added Tax (VAT) in Turkey</h2>
                    <p>The Turkish VAT system is regulated under the Value Added Tax Law No. 3065 and generally
                        possesses a structure similar to the European Union VAT system.</p>

                    <h3>VAT Rates</h3>
                    <p>Pursuant to current Presidential Decrees:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Standard VAT Rate:</strong> 20%</li>
                        <li><strong>Reduced VAT Rate:</strong> 10% (for certain groups of goods and services)</li>
                        <li><strong>Super Reduced VAT Rate:</strong> 1% (for certain basic consumer goods)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The applicable rate is determined based on the nature of the goods delivered or services
                        provided.</p>

                    <h3>Reverse Charge VAT (VAT Withholding)</h3>
                    <p>If foreign companies with no workplace or permanent representative in Turkey provide services to
                        a VAT taxpayer in Turkey, the <strong>Reverse Charge VAT</strong> mechanism applies.</p>
                    <p>In this scenario:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>VAT is calculated on the service fee.</li>
                        <li>However, the VAT is not declared by the foreign service provider, but is declared and paid
                            by the Turkish company receiving the service under the title of the "responsible party" (via
                            VAT Return No. 2).</li>
                        <li>The foreign company issues the invoice exclusive of VAT (net).</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>This mechanism may eliminate the requirement for the foreign company to establish a separate VAT
                        liability in Turkey.</p>

                    <h3>VAT Refunds</h3>
                    <p>Export deliveries are exempt from VAT. Exporters may receive a refund (in cash or via offset) for
                        the VAT they have incurred but could not deduct.</p>
                    <p>Depending on the refund amount and the method selected, the refund process may be conducted
                        through different procedures such as:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Sworn-in Certified Public Accountant (YMM) Report</li>
                        <li>Guarantee/Collateral</li>

                    <h3>Dividend Withholding Tax</h3>
                    <p>In the event that a company in Turkey distributes dividends to its partner abroad, the general
                        withholding tax rate is <strong>10%</strong>. This rate is determined by the relevant
                        Presidential Decrees.</p>

                    <h2>5. Double Taxation Treaties</h2>
                    <p>Turkey has signed Double Taxation Avoidance Agreements with more than 85 countries. If the
                        provisions of an agreement are more advantageous than domestic legislation, the agreement
                        provisions take precedence.</p>
                    <p>To benefit from DTA advantages, the following are generally required:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A <strong>Certificate of Residence</strong> obtained from the relevant country.</li>
                        <li>Fulfillment of conditions regarding the <strong>Beneficial Owner</strong> of the income.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>It is required that documents are duly certified (apostilled/legalized) by the competent
                        authorities.</p>

                    <h2>6. Conclusion</h2>
                    <p>While the corporate tax and VAT system in Turkey offers significant opportunities, it possesses a
                        technical and detailed structure. Specifically, applications such as the domestic minimum
                        corporate tax, reverse charge VAT, and withholding tax require professional planning for foreign
                        investors.</p>

                        foreign investors in all processes, from company incorporation to tax structuring, profit
