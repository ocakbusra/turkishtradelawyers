                        Turkey has emerged as a strategically significant jurisdiction for foreign direct investment due
                        to its large population, geopolitical position, and integration with international trade
                        systems. However, entering the Turkish market without adequate legal planning exposes foreign
                        companies to substantial regulatory, tax, and contractual risks.

                    <h2>Structural Reasons for Turkey's Attractiveness</h2>

                    <h3>Customs Union with the European Union</h3>
                    <p>Turkey is a party to the EU–Turkey Customs Union, primarily covering industrial goods. This
                        arrangement facilitates tariff-free circulation of qualifying goods between Turkey and EU member
                        states. However, the <strong>Customs Union does not harmonize corporate law, tax law, contract
                            law, or regulatory licensing</strong>. Accordingly, Customs Union membership does not
                        eliminate the requirement for compliance with Turkish domestic law.</p>

                    <h3>Demographic and Economic Factors</h3>
                    <p>Turkey's population is comparatively young and digitally literate, fostering strong demand in
                        sectors such as technology, e-commerce, fintech, and digital services. Furthermore, operational
                        costs—particularly labor-related expenses—remain lower than in many Western European
                        jurisdictions, subject to strict compliance with <a href="glossary/labor-law.html"
                            style="color: #2D4CC8; text-decoration: none;">Turkish labor</a> and <a
                            href="glossary/social-security.html" style="color: #2D4CC8; text-decoration: none;">social
                            security legislation</a>.</p>

                    <h3>Legal Autonomy as a Risk Factor</h3>
                    <p>While Turkey aligns with certain international standards, it retains full sovereignty over its
                        commercial, tax, and regulatory regimes. Consequently, <strong>market entry without localized
                            legal planning</strong> frequently results in unforeseen liabilities, administrative
                        penalties, or contractual invalidity.</p>

                    <div class="callout-box"

                        <strong>⚠️ Key Risk:</strong> Assuming that EU law standards apply directly in Turkey is one of
                        the most common mistakes made by foreign companies and often leads to significant compliance
                        failures.

                    <h2>Legal Market Entry Models Under Turkish Law</h2>

                    <h3>1. Direct Export Model</h3>
                    <p>Under a direct export structure, foreign companies sell goods or services to Turkish
                        counterparties without establishing a local legal presence. This model may give rise to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><a href="glossary/customs-procedures.html"
                                style="color: #2D4CC8; text-decoration: none;">Customs duties</a></li>
                        <li>Import <a href="glossary/vat-turkey.html"
                                style="color: #2D4CC8; text-decoration: none;">VAT</a></li>
                        <li><a href="glossary/withholding-tax.html"
                                style="color: #2D4CC8; text-decoration: none;">Withholding tax</a> obligations on
                            certain services</li>
                        <li>Permanent establishment risks</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Contrary to common assumptions, <strong>direct export does not inherently eliminate Turkish tax
                            or regulatory exposure</strong>.</p>

                    <h3>2. Distributor and Commercial Agent Structures</h3>
                    <p>Foreign companies may operate through Turkish distributors or commercial agents governed by the
                        Turkish Commercial Code. Key legal risks include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Statutory <a href="glossary/agency-agreement.html"
                                style="color: #2D4CC8; text-decoration: none;">agent compensation</a> claims upon
                            termination</li>
                        <li>Requalification of distributors as agents based on factual dependency</li>
                        <li>Tax exposure through improperly structured commission arrangements</li>
                        <li>Enforceability issues arising from non-compliant contract clauses</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><a href="glossary/due-diligence.html" style="color: #2D4CC8; text-decoration: none;">Due
                            diligence</a> and contract drafting consistent with mandatory Turkish law are indispensable.
                    </p>

                    <h3>3. Liaison Office (İrtibat Bürosu)</h3>
                    <p>A <a href="glossary/liaison-office.html" style="color: #2D4CC8; text-decoration: none;">liaison

                            General Questions</h3>

                        <div class="faq-item" style="margin-bottom: 1.25rem;">
                            <h4 style="font-size: 1rem; color: #1a2742; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">What is the safest way
                                for a foreign company to enter the Turkish market?</h4>
                            <p style="color: #4B5563;">The safest way depends on the scope and duration of the intended
                                activity. For continuous, revenue-generating operations, establishing a Turkish company
                                provides the highest level of legal certainty. Direct export, distributor arrangements,
                                and liaison offices may be suitable in limited scenarios but carry specific tax and
                                compliance risks under Turkish law.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="faq-item" style="margin-bottom: 1.25rem;">
                            <h4 style="font-size: 1rem; color: #1a2742; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Does Turkey follow EU
                                company law?</h4>
                            <p style="color: #4B5563;">No. Although Turkey is part of the EU–Turkey Customs Union for
                                industrial goods, Turkish company law, tax law, and regulatory licensing regimes are
                                autonomous. EU legal structures do not automatically apply in Turkey.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="faq-item" style="margin-bottom: 1.25rem;">
                            <h4 style="font-size: 1rem; color: #1a2742; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Is Turkey legally safe
                                for foreign investors?</h4>
                            <p style="color: #4B5563;">Yes. Turkey permits 100% foreign ownership in most sectors and
                                provides legal protections for foreign investors. However, compliance with Turkish
                                commercial, tax, labor, and regulatory law is mandatory.</p>

                                sell to Turkey without opening a company?</h4>
                            <p style="color: #4B5563;">Yes. A foreign company may sell goods or services to Turkey
                                through direct export. However, customs duties, import VAT, withholding tax, and
                                permanent establishment risks may arise depending on the transaction structure.</p>

                                eliminate Turkish tax obligations?</h4>
                            <p style="color: #4B5563;">No. Certain services and recurring commercial activities may
                                trigger withholding tax or permanent establishment risks even without a Turkish entity.

                                between a distributor and a commercial agent in Turkey?</h4>
                            <p style="color: #4B5563;">A distributor sells products in its own name, while a commercial
                                agent acts on behalf of the foreign principal. Under Turkish law, commercial agents
                                benefit from statutory protection, including termination compensation rights.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="faq-item" style="margin-bottom: 1.25rem;">

                                mandatory under Turkish law?</h4>
                            <p style="color: #4B5563;">Yes, if the relationship qualifies as an agency under Turkish
                                Commercial Code rules. Improper classification or termination may result in mandatory
                                compensation obligations.</p>

                                in Turkey?</h4>
                            <p style="color: #4B5563;">A liaison office is a non-commercial presence allowed to conduct
                                activities such as market research, promotion, and coordination. It may not sell,
                                invoice, or generate income in Turkey.</p>

                            <p style="color: #4B5563;">Liaison offices are supervised by the Ministry of Industry and
                                Technology, specifically the General Directorate of Incentive Implementation and Foreign
                                Capital.</p>

                                extended indefinitely?</h4>
                            <p style="color: #4B5563;">No. Extension applications are reviewed based on past activities
                                and the amount of foreign currency transferred from abroad. Authorities increasingly
                                conduct substantive compliance audits.</p>

                            <p style="color: #4B5563;">No. Limited liability companies are not subject to a
                                pre-registration capital blocking requirement. The full capital may be paid within 24
                                months after registration.</p>
