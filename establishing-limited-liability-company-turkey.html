                        The limited liability company (Limited Şirket) constitutes the most frequently adopted corporate
                        form by foreign investors seeking to establish a business presence in Turkey. Its legal
                        structure offers a balance between limited shareholder liability and operational flexibility,
                        making it particularly suitable for small and medium-sized enterprises as well as foreign
                        subsidiaries.
                    </p>
                    <p>This article examines the legal framework governing the establishment of limited liability
                        companies in Turkey, with a focus on minimum capital requirements, shareholder and manager
                        liability, incorporation procedures, mandatory payments, and a comparative assessment with joint
                        stock companies. The analysis reflects the legal regime applicable as of 2026.</p>

                <section id="introduction" class="article-content">
                    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
                    <p>Corporate structuring represents one of the most critical decisions for foreign investors
                        entering a new jurisdiction. In Turkey, the choice between different company types has direct
                        implications for liability exposure, governance, taxation, and long-term compliance obligations.
                        Among the available corporate forms, the limited liability company has emerged as the preferred
                        structure for foreign investors due to its relatively low capital threshold and simplified
                        management model.</p>
                    <p>This study aims to provide a systematic examination of the establishment process of a limited
                        liability company under Turkish law, highlighting both doctrinal principles and practical
                        considerations.</p>
                </section>

                <section id="legal-character" class="article-content">
                    <h2>2. Legal Character of the Limited Liability Company</h2>
                    <p>Under the Turkish Commercial Code, a limited liability company is classified as a capital company
                        possessing independent legal personality. The company is distinct from its shareholders, and as
                        a general rule, it bears sole responsibility for its debts and obligations.</p>
                    <p>The defining legal features of a limited liability company include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Separate legal personality</li>
                        <li>Capital-based structure</li>
                        <li>Limited liability of shareholders</li>
                        <li>Centralized management through one or more managers</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Unlike partnerships, shareholder liability does not extend to personal assets, subject to
                        narrowly defined statutory exceptions.</p>
                </section>

                <section id="shareholders" class="article-content">
                    <h2>3. Shareholders and Eligibility</h2>
                    <p>A limited liability company may be established by:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A single individual or legal entity</li>
                        <li>Multiple individuals or legal entities</li>
                        <li>Foreign nationals and foreign-incorporated entities</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Turkish law imposes no nationality or residency requirement on shareholders. The presence of
                        foreign shareholders does not alter the legal nature of the company.</p>
                </section>

                <section id="capital" class="article-content">
                    <h2>4. Minimum Capital Requirement</h2>
                    <p>The statutory minimum capital for a limited liability company is <strong>50,000 Turkish
                            Lira</strong>. This amount constitutes the legal lower threshold for incorporation.</p>
                    <p>Capital may be subscribed in cash or in kind, subject to valuation and registration rules. The
                        capital commitment must be fully undertaken at incorporation, while payment may be completed
                        within the legally prescribed period.</p>

                    <h3>5.1 Preliminary Identification of Foreign Shareholders</h3>
                    <p>Where shareholders or managers are foreign individuals, the incorporation process typically
                        commences with the issuance of a potential tax identification number. This administrative
                        identifier enables the individual to be registered in official systems and to participate in
                        notarial and registry procedures.</p>

                    <h3>5.2 Preparation of Incorporation Documents</h3>
                    <p>The <a href="glossary.html" style="color: #2D4CC8; text-decoration: none;">articles of
                            association</a> constitute the foundational document of the company and must include, inter
                        alia:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Company name and registered address</li>
                        <li>Scope of business activities</li>
                        <li>Capital structure and share distribution</li>
                        <li>Management and representation rules</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The articles are prepared and submitted through the central registry system in accordance with
                        statutory templates.</p>

                    <h3>5.3 Appointment of Managers and Notarial Formalities</h3>
                    <p>The company is managed by one or more managers, who may be shareholders or third parties.
                        Managerial authority and representation powers must be clearly defined. Signature declarations
                        of managers are notarized and submitted to the trade registry. Notarial formalities serve as a
                        preventive mechanism ensuring authenticity and legal certainty.</p>

                    <h3>5.4 Registration with the Trade Registry</h3>
                    <p>Legal personality is acquired upon registration with the trade registry. Registration is followed
                        by publication in the Trade Registry Gazette, rendering the company legally operative.</p>

                        calculated at <strong>0.04 percent (on binde dört)</strong> of the subscribed capital. This
                        payment constitutes a mandatory procedural step and forms part of the establishment costs,

                    <h3>8.1 Shareholder Liability</h3>
                    <p>Shareholders are liable solely to the extent of their subscribed capital. Personal liability does
                        not arise from ordinary commercial debts of the company. Exceptions are limited and primarily
                        relate to unpaid capital contributions and certain public receivables.</p>

                    <h3>8.2 Manager Liability</h3>
                    <p>Managers bear broader responsibilities and may incur personal liability in cases involving:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Non-payment of public debts</li>
                        <li>Breach of statutory duties</li>
                        <li>Failure to comply with mandatory filing and reporting obligations</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>11. Conclusion</h2>
                    <p>The limited liability company remains a legally robust and operationally efficient vehicle for
                        foreign investors under Turkish commercial law. Its moderate capital requirement, flexible
                        management structure, and limited shareholder liability render it particularly attractive for
                        market entry and subsidiary formation. Nevertheless, the legal consequences of manager
                        appointments, capital commitments, and mandatory procedural steps must be carefully assessed to
                        ensure long-term compliance and risk mitigation.</p>
