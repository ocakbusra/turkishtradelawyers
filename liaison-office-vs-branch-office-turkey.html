                        Foreign companies entering the Turkish market frequently face a critical structural decision at
                        the initial stage of market entry: whether to establish a <a href="glossary.html"
                            style="color: #2D4CC8; text-decoration: none;">liaison office</a> or a branch office. These
                        two legal presences differ fundamentally in terms of permitted activities, tax exposure,
                        regulatory oversight, and long-term strategic implications.
                    </p>
                    <p>This article provides a comprehensive and up-to-date comparative analysis of liaison offices and
                        branch offices in Turkey as of 2026, focusing on legal status, establishment procedures,
                        operational scope, costs, and compliance obligations. The aim is to assist foreign investors in
                        selecting the most suitable model based on their business objectives.</p>

                <section id="introduction" class="article-content">
                    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
                    <p>Turkey remains an attractive market for foreign companies due to its large domestic demand,
                        strategic geographic position, and integration with international trade routes. However, the
                        legal form through which a foreign company enters Turkey has direct consequences on its
                        operational flexibility, tax exposure, and regulatory burden.</p>
                    <p>Among the most commonly confused concepts are liaison offices and branch offices. Although both
                        allow a foreign company to establish a physical presence in Turkey, they serve fundamentally
                        different purposes. Choosing the wrong structure often leads to regulatory violations,
                        unexpected tax liabilities, or forced restructuring at a later stage.</p>

                <section id="legal-nature" class="article-content">
                    <h2>2. Legal Nature of Liaison Offices and Branch Offices</h2>

                    <h3>2.1 Liaison Office</h3>
                    <p>A liaison office is not a separate legal entity and does not constitute a commercial enterprise
                        under Turkish law. It operates as a representative unit of the foreign parent company and is
                        strictly prohibited from engaging in commercial activities. Its legal basis primarily derives
                        from foreign investment regulations and administrative practice.</p>

                    <h3>2.2 Branch Office</h3>
                    <p>A branch office is also not a separate legal entity but is considered an extension of the foreign
                        parent company that may conduct commercial activities in Turkey. Unlike a liaison office, a
                        branch may generate revenue, enter into contracts, and issue invoices. From a legal and tax
                        perspective, a branch is treated similarly to a local business operation.</p>
                </section>

                <section id="permitted-activities" class="article-content">
                    <h2>3. Permitted Activities and Operational Scope</h2>
                    <p>One of the most decisive differences lies in the scope of permitted activities.</p>

                    <h3>3.1 Liaison Office Activities</h3>
                    <p>Permitted activities are limited to non-commercial functions such as:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Market research and feasibility studies</li>
                        <li>Promotion and advertising of the parent company</li>
                        <li>Coordination and communication activities</li>
                        <li>Quality control and supplier audits</li>
                        <li>Representation and information gathering</li>
                    </ul>
                    <div class="callout-box"
                        style="background-color: #FEF2F2; border-left: 4px solid #DC2626; padding: 1rem 1.5rem; margin: 1.5rem 0; color: #991B1B;">
                        <strong>⚠️ Critical Limitation:</strong> Any activity that directly or indirectly generates
                        income in Turkey is prohibited for liaison offices.
                    </div>

                    <h3>3.2 Branch Office Activities</h3>
                    <p>A branch office may:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Conduct commercial transactions</li>
                        <li>Sign contracts with customers and suppliers</li>
                        <li>Issue invoices</li>
                        <li>Generate income in Turkey</li>
                        <li>Employ staff for operational purposes</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>In practice, a branch operates as an active commercial arm of the foreign company.</p>

                    <h2>4. Establishment Procedures and Regulatory Authorities</h2>

                    <h3>4.1 Liaison Office Establishment</h3>
                    <p>Liaison offices require permission from the Ministry of Industry and Technology. The application
                        process involves:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Submission of corporate documents of the parent company</li>

                    <p>Branch offices are established through registration with the trade registry. The process
                        includes:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Parent company resolutions</li>
                        <li>Appointment of a branch manager</li>
                        <li>Capital allocation</li>
                        <li>Registration and announcement</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Unlike liaison offices, no prior administrative permission is required beyond standard
                        registration.</p>

                    <h2>12. Conclusion</h2>
                    <p>The choice between a liaison office and a branch office in Turkey should be based on a clear
                        understanding of business objectives, risk appetite, and long-term plans. Liaison offices
                        provide a controlled and low-risk entry point but come with strict activity limitations and
                        temporary permissions. Branch offices offer operational flexibility and revenue generation
                        capabilities at the cost of increased regulatory and tax obligations. A legally informed
                        decision at the outset significantly reduces future restructuring risks and compliance exposure.
