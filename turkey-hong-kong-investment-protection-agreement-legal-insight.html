                <section id="introduction" class="article-content">
                    <p>The <strong>Agreement between the Republic of Türkiye and the Hong Kong Special Administrative
                            Region of the People’s Republic of China for the Reciprocal Promotion and Protection of
                            Investments</strong> has officially entered into force following its approval by <strong>Law
                            No. 7570</strong>, published in the Official Gazette dated <strong>27 December 2025 (No.
                            33120)</strong>.</p>
                    <p>Signed on <strong>1 June 2023 in Ankara</strong> and <strong>31 October 2023 in Hong
                            Kong</strong>, the Agreement now forms part of Türkiye’s domestic legal order and
                        establishes a binding international investment protection regime between the two jurisdictions.
                    </p>
                    <p>From a legal and commercial perspective, the Agreement is designed to enhance
                        <strong>predictability, stability, and enforceability</strong> for cross-border investments.
                    </p>
                </section>

                <section id="scope-of-protection" class="article-content">
                    <h2>Scope of Protection</h2>
                    <p>The Agreement applies to <strong>all investments</strong>, whether made <strong>before or after
                            its entry into force</strong>, provided they are established in accordance with the host
                        state’s laws. Investments are defined broadly and include movable and immovable property,
                        shares, contractual claims with financial value, intellectual property rights, and business
                        concessions.</p>
                    <p>Both <strong>natural persons</strong> and <strong>enterprises</strong> qualifying as investors
                        under Turkish or Hong Kong law are covered.</p>
                </section>

                <section id="core-standards" class="article-content">
                    <h2>Core Standards of Treatment</h2>
                    <p>Under the Agreement, each Contracting Party undertakes to ensure:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Fair and equitable treatment</strong>, including protection against denial of
                            justice and violations of due process</li>
                        <li><strong>Full protection and security</strong>, limited to the customary international law
                            minimum standard</li>
                        <li>Protection against <strong>unreasonable or discriminatory measures</strong> affecting the
                            management, use, or disposal of investments</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Importantly, the Agreement clarifies that these standards do not create obligations beyond
                        customary international law, reducing interpretative uncertainty often seen in older investment
                        treaties.</p>
                </section>

                <section id="expropriation" class="article-content">
                    <h2>Expropriation and Compensation</h2>
                    <p>The Agreement provides detailed safeguards against <strong>direct and indirect
                            expropriation</strong>. Any expropriation must:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Serve a <strong>public purpose</strong></li>
                        <li>Be carried out on a <strong>non-discriminatory basis</strong></li>
                        <li>Comply with <strong>due process of law</strong></li>
                        <li>Be accompanied by <strong>prompt, adequate, and effective compensation</strong></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Compensation must reflect the <strong>real value of the investment immediately before
                            expropriation</strong>, include interest, and be freely transferable in a freely usable
                        currency.</p>
                </section>

                <section id="transfer-of-investments" class="article-content">
                    <h2>Transfer of Investments and Returns</h2>
                    <p>Investors are guaranteed the <strong>free and unrestricted transfer</strong> of:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Capital contributions</li>
                        <li>Profits, dividends, and other returns</li>
                        <li>Proceeds from sale or liquidation</li>
                        <li>Payments related to compensation or dispute settlement</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Limited exceptions are permitted, such as in cases of insolvency, criminal enforcement, or
                        serious balance-of-payments difficulties, provided measures are applied in good faith and on a
                        non-discriminatory basis.</p>
                </section>

                <section id="dispute-settlement" class="article-content">
                    <h2>Investor–State Dispute Settlement</h2>
                    <p>One of the most significant features of the Agreement is the <strong>Investor–State Dispute
                            Settlement (ISDS)</strong> mechanism.</p>
                    <p>After an initial consultation period, investors may submit disputes to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules</strong>, or</li>
                        <li>Another agreed arbitral institution or set of rules</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Both Türkiye and Hong Kong have given <strong>advance consent to arbitration</strong>, and
                        arbitral awards are enforceable under the <strong>New York Convention</strong>. This provides
                        investors with an enforceable remedy outside domestic courts.</p>
                </section>

                <section id="why-it-matters" class="article-content">
                    <h2>Why This Agreement Matters</h2>
                    <p>For investors operating between Türkiye and Hong Kong—particularly in <strong>finance, trade,
                            technology, manufacturing, and cross-border services</strong>—the Agreement significantly
                        strengthens legal certainty by:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Reducing sovereign risk</li>
                        <li>Ensuring enforceable investor protections</li>
                        <li>Aligning with modern international investment treaty standards</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>It also reflects a more balanced approach, preserving each state’s <strong>right to
                            regulate</strong> in areas such as public order, health, environment, and financial
                        stability.</p>
