                    <h2>Expert Dispute Resolution & Corporate Discovery for United Kingdom Enterprises in Türkiye</h2>
                    <p>Trade volume between Turkey and the <strong>United Kingdom</strong> has surged following the
                        post-Brexit Free Trade Agreement. However, for British companies, navigating the Turkish legal
                        landscape—rooted in Civil Law rather than Common Law—can be challenging.</p>

                    <p>At Turkish Trade Lawyers, we bridge the gap. We provide specialized litigation, debt recovery,
                        and corporate intelligence services tailored for <strong>United Kingdom</strong> entities,
                        ensuring your rights are enforced under the International Private and Procedure Law (MÖHUK).</p>
                </section>

                <section id="litigation" class="article-content">
                    <h3>1. Litigation: Bridging the "Common Law" Gap</h3>
                    <p>In the <strong>United Kingdom</strong>, litigation often involves a heavy "Discovery" phase where
                        all documents are shared. In Turkey, the burden of proof lies strictly with the plaintiff. We
                        manage this transition for you.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Commercial Court of First Instance (Asliye Ticaret Mahkemesi):</strong> We represent
                            <strong>UK</strong> firms in complex commercial disputes.</li>
                        <li><strong>Mandatory Mediation (Dava Şartı Arabuluculuk):</strong> Under Turkish Commercial
                            Code, you generally cannot file a lawsuit for monetary claims without first attempting
                            mediation. We represent <strong>British</strong> clients in these mediation sessions to
                            achieve quick settlements (often in 4-8 weeks) without entering the lengthy court system.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Security for Costs (Cautio Judicatum Solvi):</strong> Under MÖHUK Article 48,
                            foreign plaintiffs are often required to deposit a security fee. However, we argue for
                            exemptions based on reciprocity principles between Turkey and the <strong>United
                                Kingdom</strong>.</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>

                <section id="enforcement" class="article-content">
                    <h3>2. Enforcement of UK Judgments in Turkey (Tanıma ve Tenfiz)</h3>
                    <p>If you have won a court case in London, it is not automatically valid in Istanbul. We execute the
                        "Enforcement Lawsuit" (Tenfiz Davası) to make your <strong>UK</strong> judgment collectible in
                        Turkey.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>The Prerequisite:</strong> The ruling from the <strong>United Kingdom</strong> court
                            must be final and binding.</li>
                        <li><strong>Reciprocity:</strong> While there is no specific bilateral enforcement treaty for
                            all civil matters, we leverage "de facto reciprocity" and specific conventions to validate
                            <strong>British</strong> court decisions.</li>
                        <li><strong>Arbitral Awards:</strong> Turkey is a signatory to the New York Convention. If your
                            contract with a Turkish partner has an arbitration clause (e.g., LCIA), enforcing these
                            awards is significantly faster than local court judgments.</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>

                <section id="corporate-discovery" class="article-content">
                    <h3>3. Corporate Discovery & Due Diligence (Delil Tespiti)</h3>
                    <p>"Discovery" as known in the UK/US does not exist in Turkey. However, we utilize the
                        "Determination of Evidence" (Delil Tespiti) mechanism under the Code of Civil Procedure (HMK).
                    </p>

                    <p>Before you sue or partner with a Turkish firm, we conduct a forensic legal audit:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Asset Tracing:</strong> Locating real estate, vehicles, and registered shares owned
                            by the debtor.</li>
                        <li><strong>Trade Registry Analysis:</strong> Verifying the signatory authorities and capital
                            structure via MERSIS (Central Registry System).</li>
                        <li><strong>Bankruptcy Check:</strong> Determining if the Turkish counterparty has filed for
                            Konkordato (Concordat) or is in bankruptcy proceedings.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Proper notification is the backbone of Turkish litigation. Since both Turkey and the
                        <strong>United Kingdom</strong> are parties to the Hague Convention on the Service Abroad,
                        strict protocols must be followed.</p>

                        <strong>Avoid the Pitfall:</strong> Sending a legal notice via standard international courier
                        (DHL/FedEx) is not legally valid for court proceedings in Turkey.
                    </div>

                    <p><strong>Our Solution:</strong> We handle the official notification process through the Public
                        Prosecutor’s office and the Ministry of Justice to ensure your legal deadlines are preserved.

                    <h2>FAQ: Legal Concerns for British Investors</h2>

                    <h3>Q: Can I sue a Turkish company in English courts?</h3>
                    <p>A: Yes, if your contract grants jurisdiction to <strong>UK</strong> courts. However, enforcing
                        that judgment in Turkey requires a separate "Enforcement Lawsuit." Often, suing directly in
                        Turkey is faster for asset recovery.</p>

                    <h3>Q: Is arbitration better than Turkish Courts for UK firms?</h3>
                    <p>A: Generally, yes. Arbitration (ISTAC or International) avoids the backlog of local courts and

                    <h3>Q: How long does a commercial lawsuit take in Turkey?</h3>
                    <p>A: A typical commercial case in First Instance Courts can take 12-18 months. Appeal stages may
                        add time. This is why our strategy prioritizes Mandatory Mediation and Pre-judgment Attachments
