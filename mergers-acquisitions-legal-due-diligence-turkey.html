                    <h2>1. Introduction: Why Legal Due Diligence Is Critical in Turkish M&A Transactions</h2>
                    <p>Turkey has become an increasingly attractive market for foreign investors seeking growth through
                        <strong>mergers and acquisitions (M&A)</strong>. Strategic location, a large domestic market,
                        and competitive operational costs make Turkish companies appealing acquisition targets.
                    </p>

                    <p>However, <strong>company acquisition in Turkish law</strong> involves legal, regulatory, and
                        structural risks that are often underestimated by foreign buyers. Unlike some jurisdictions
                        where disclosures are standardized, in Turkey, hidden liabilities, compliance gaps, and
                        shareholder-level risks may only surface through a properly conducted <a

                    <p>This article provides a practical, transaction-oriented <strong>legal due diligence
                            checklist</strong> for <strong>mergers and acquisitions in Turkey</strong>, designed for:

                    <h2>2. Mergers & Acquisitions in Turkey: Legal Framework Overview</h2>

                    <h3>2.1 What Does "Company Acquisition" Mean Under Turkish Law?</h3>
                    <p>Under Turkish law, acquisitions are typically structured as:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong><a href="glossary/share-purchase.html"
                                    style="color: #2D4CC8; text-decoration: none;">Share purchases</a></strong>
                            (acquisition of shares in an existing company), or</li>
                        <li><strong><a href="glossary/asset-purchase.html"
                                    style="color: #2D4CC8; text-decoration: none;">Asset purchases</a></strong>
                            (acquisition of specific business assets).</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>The most common M&A structure in Turkey is a <strong>share acquisition</strong>, governed
                        primarily by:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Turkish Commercial Code</li>
                        <li>Turkish Code of Obligations</li>
                        <li>Sector-specific regulations (banking, energy, fintech, etc.)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <div class="callout-box"
                        style="background-color: #FEF2F2; border-left: 4px solid #DC2626; padding: 1rem 1.5rem; margin: 1.5rem 0; color: #991B1B;">
                        <strong>⚠️ Important:</strong> From a risk perspective, share acquisitions transfer not only
                        ownership but also <strong>historical liabilities</strong>, making legal due diligence
                        indispensable.
                    </div>

                    <h3>2.2 Why "Turkey Due Diligence" Is Not a Formality</h3>
                    <p>In many failed or disputed acquisitions, the root cause is not the transaction itself but
                        <strong>insufficient pre-acquisition legal review</strong>.
                    </p>

                    <p>Key reasons due diligence is critical in Turkey:</p>

                        <li>Unresolved employee claims under <a href="glossary/labor-law.html"

                        <li>Invalid or defective corporate approvals</li>
                        <li>Undisclosed shareholder disputes</li>

                    <h2>12. Conclusion: Due Diligence Is Not a Cost, It Is Risk Insurance</h2>
                    <p>In <strong>mergers and acquisitions in Turkey</strong>, legal due diligence is not a box-ticking
                        exercise. It is a <strong>strategic decision-making tool</strong> that protects:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Capital</li>
                        <li>Transaction validity</li>
                        <li>Long-term investment value</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>A properly executed <strong>Turkey due diligence</strong> process enables investors to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Understand what they are truly buying</li>
                        <li>Negotiate from a position of strength</li>
                        <li>Avoid costly post-acquisition disputes</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h2>

                    <div class="faq-item" style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                        <h3 style="font-size: 1.1rem; color: #1a2742;">Q1. What is legal due diligence in Turkey?</h3>
                        <p>Legal due diligence in Turkey is the structured review of a target company's corporate
                            records, contracts, litigation exposure, employment compliance, regulatory permits, and
                            ownership restrictions to identify risks before signing or closing an acquisition.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="faq-item" style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                        <h3 style="font-size: 1.1rem; color: #1a2742;">Q2. How long does due diligence take for a
                            Turkish company acquisition?</h3>
                        <p>Timing depends on document readiness and deal complexity. Most mid-market acquisitions
                            require a staged review process (corporate + contracts + disputes + compliance) before SPA
                            finalization and closing.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="faq-item" style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                        <h3 style="font-size: 1.1rem; color: #1a2742;">Q3. What are the biggest legal risks in Turkish
                            M&A transactions?</h3>
                        <p>Common high-impact risks include hidden liabilities, defective corporate approvals,
                            unresolved litigation, employment claims, regulatory licensing gaps, and share transfer
                            restrictions.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="faq-item" style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                        <h3 style="font-size: 1.1rem; color: #1a2742;">Q4. Is a Share Purchase Agreement (SPA) mandatory
                            in Turkey?</h3>
                        <p>Turkish law does not impose one single "mandatory" SPA template, but a written share transfer
                            agreement is the market standard for allocating risks through warranties, indemnities, and
                            closing conditions.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="faq-item" style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                        <h3 style="font-size: 1.1rem; color: #1a2742;">Q5. Can a share transfer be blocked in a Turkish
                            A.Ş.?</h3>
                        <p>Yes. Depending on the Articles of Association, <a href="glossary/shareholders-agreement.html"
                                style="color: #2D4CC8; text-decoration: none;">shareholder agreements</a>, pledge
                            rights, or sector-specific regulations, share transfers may require approvals or may be
                            restricted.</p>

                        <h3 style="font-size: 1.1rem; color: #1a2742;">Q6. What documents should a buyer request during
                            Turkey due diligence?</h3>
                        <p>Buyers typically request trade registry records, share ledgers, <a

                                style="color: #2D4CC8; text-decoration: none;">board</a> and <a

                    </div>

                    <div class="faq-item" style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                        <h3 style="font-size: 1.1rem; color: #1a2742;">Q7. How are due diligence findings reflected in
                            the SPA?</h3>
                        <p>Findings are typically addressed through representations and warranties, specific
                            indemnities, escrow/holdback arrangements, price adjustments, and closing conditions.</p>
                    </div>

                            for acquisitions in Turkey?</h3>
                        <p>Sometimes. Depending on the sector (e.g., regulated industries) and transaction
                            size/structure, approvals or notifications may be required.</p>
