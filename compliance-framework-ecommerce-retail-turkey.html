                        Türkiye applies a highly <a href="glossary/consumer-protection.html"
                            style="color: #2D4CC8; text-decoration: none;">consumer-protective legal regime</a> that
                        directly affects foreign e-commerce businesses and retailers selling goods or services to
                        consumers located in the country.
                    </p>
                    <p>The scope of Turkish <a href="glossary/consumer-protection.html"
                            style="color: #2D4CC8; text-decoration: none;">consumer protection law</a> extends beyond
                        territorial boundaries and applies irrespective of the seller’s place of establishment,
                        governing law clauses, or payment currency. This article examines the core compliance
                        obligations arising from Law No. 6502 on Consumer Protection, with particular focus on <a

                        regulatory, financial, and operational risks when selling to consumers in Türkiye.</p>
                </section>

                <section id="introduction" class="article-content">
                    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
                    <p>Foreign businesses entering the Turkish consumer market often prioritize <a
                            href="glossary/customs-procedures.html"
                            style="color: #2D4CC8; text-decoration: none;">customs</a>, tax, or <a
                            href="glossary/company-formation.html"
                            style="color: #2D4CC8; text-decoration: none;">corporate structuring</a> issues. In
                        practice, however, the first legal exposure frequently arises from consumer complaints, refund
                        claims, or marketplace enforcement actions. Turkish consumer protection law is mandatory in
                        nature and leaves limited room for contractual flexibility.</p>
                    <p>Any foreign seller engaging in consumer-facing transactions with individuals located in Türkiye
                        must assess its compliance position under Turkish law. Failure to do so may result in
                        administrative sanctions, forced refunds, payment service restrictions, or suspension from
                        online marketplaces.</p>

                    <h2>2. Scope of Application of Turkish Consumer Protection Law</h2>

                    <h3>2.1 Definition of Consumer</h3>
                    <p>Under Law No. 6502, a consumer is defined as a real or legal person acting for purposes outside
                        their commercial or professional activities. This definition focuses on the nature of the
                        transaction rather than the identity or nationality of the seller.</p>
                    <p>Turkish consumer protection law applies where:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The buyer is located in Türkiye,</li>
                        <li>The transaction is concluded for personal or non-commercial use,</li>
                        <li>The product or service is delivered, accessed, or performed in Türkiye.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The seller’s lack of physical presence in Türkiye does not prevent the application of consumer
                        protection rules.</p>
                </section>

                <section id="liability-defective-goods" class="article-content">
                    <h2>3. Liability for Defective Goods and Services</h2>

                    <h3>3.1 Concept of Defect</h3>
                    <p>A good or service is deemed defective if it:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Fails to comply with contractual terms,</li>
                        <li>Lacks qualities advertised or reasonably expected,</li>
                        <li>Is unfit for ordinary or agreed use,</li>
                        <li>Contains hidden defects discovered after delivery.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>This concept applies equally to physical goods, digital products, software, online services, and
                        subscription-based offerings.</p>

                    <h3>3.2 Consumer Remedies</h3>
                    <p>In the event of a defect, the consumer has the unilateral right to choose one of the following
                        remedies:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><a href="glossary/contract-termination.html"
                                style="color: #2D4CC8; text-decoration: none;">Termination of the contract</a> and
                            refund,</li>
                        <li>Replacement with a non-defective product,</li>
                        <li>Free repair,</li>
                        <li>Percentage price reduction proportional to the defect.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The seller may not restrict or override the consumer’s choice.</p>

                    <h3>3.3 Limitation Periods</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>General liability period: two years from delivery,</li>
                        <li>Hidden defects: limitation period starts upon discovery,</li>

                    <h2>4. Right of Withdrawal in Distance Sales</h2>

                    <h3>4.1 General Rule</h3>
                    <p>For distance contracts concluded through electronic means, consumers have the right to withdraw
                        from the contract within <strong>fourteen days</strong> without providing justification and
                        without incurring any penalty.</p>

                    <h3>4.2 Commencement of the Withdrawal Period</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Sale of goods: from the date of delivery,</li>
                        <li><a href="glossary/service-agreement.html"
                                style="color: #2D4CC8; text-decoration: none;">Service contracts</a>: from the date of

                    </ul>

                    <h3>4.3 Seller Obligations</h3>
                    <p>The seller must:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Inform the consumer of the withdrawal right prior to contract formation,</li>
                        <li>Provide a clear and accessible withdrawal mechanism,</li>
                        <li>Refund all payments, including delivery costs, within fourteen days. <strong>Return shipping
                                costs are borne by the seller</strong> if the consumer uses the specified carrier.</li>
                    </ul>

                        <strong>⚠️ Important:</strong> If the consumer is not duly informed, the withdrawal period may
                        extend up to twelve months. Contractual clauses excluding refunds or labeling sales as final are
                        legally ineffective under Turkish law.

                        within the statutory fourteen-day period, provided the device is returned in its original
                        condition without signs of extensive use. The
                        previous regulation attempting to exclude these items from the scope of withdrawal rights has
                        been abolished in favor of the consumer.</p>

                    <p>Consumer protection law in Türkiye constitutes a frontline regulatory risk for foreign e-commerce
                        businesses and retailers. Statutory consumer rights are mandatory and cannot be contractually
                        waived or limited. Companies that proactively align their consumer-facing operations with
                        Turkish law significantly reduce legal exposure, financial loss, and operational disruption when
                        selling to Türkiye.</p>
